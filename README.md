# Schedule
Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 8-9 am EST.
Why are you choosing this time?  Well, I do have a day job that lets me talk to customers, which I love to do, but this also means I have a set schedule during the day.  I'm guessing other people would have trouble watching during the day all of the time, so this presents a possible time when people are more likely to be available.
