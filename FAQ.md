For example, your organization might have a password security policy that locks you out after a certain number of failed attempts to sign in. Or perhaps your PC encountered a hardware malfunction, an unexpected configuration change, or another security event. Requiring a recovery key helps ensure that only an authorized person can unlock your PC and restore access to your encrypted data.<br><br></span></div></div><!-- end ngRepeat: item in items --><div class="faq-panel ng-scope ng-isolate-scope" ng-repeat="item in items" faq-panel-content="item"><a title=" How can I get my BitLocker recovery key?
