# Projects

I have a collection of projects taking up my interest over the past several months that continue to require updating and minor improvements.  In addition, there are a number of technologies I want to dive into and build sample projects.  Here is a short list of things I plan to work on as part of the stream (in no order).

* Container Camp - a project started with a number of friends from work that provides a foundation for a developer focused container workshop.  We continue to enhance and release updates to this project.  You can see this project at https://github.com/microsoft/MTC_ContainerCamp
* Speaker Portal - this is a basic project to start with but will be one that we can continually improve with the community.  This application collects talk ideas for a conference.  Accepted talks are put into a schedule.  Authenticated users can plan out their schedule for the conference as well as provide feedback on the sessions.  https://github.com/richross/SpeakerPortal
* BOTS - many people are interested in talking about bots.  I've done conversation bot projects using ASP.NET 4.x framework, but want to build one using the Azure Bot Service.  This bot would provide information on a local community event in this area called Code Camp, listing speakers, sessions and general information.  https://dev.botframework.com 
* Cognitive Services - including AI in your applications does not always require a Data Scientist.  There are about 30 different services available to easily give your application intelligence, resulting in an improved user exeperience.  For this project, I would like to explore the Custom Vision API.  https://microsoft.com/cognitive

Have an Azure service you want to see included in a project?  Submit it in the issue list and tag it 'Project Ideas'.  If already see the idea as part of an existing project, write the issue there.
